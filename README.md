The question about the drink of choice for Haskell developers who want to use cool libraries doesn't have a direct answer in the provided search results. The search results focus on discussions about Haskell libraries, GUI libraries, and programming examples in Haskell, but they do not mention any specific drinks associated with Haskell developers or their preferences.

Given the nature of the question, it's important to note that the choice of drink among developers can vary widely based on personal preferences, cultural context, and the specific community or subculture within the programming world. While some developers might prefer traditional coffee or tea, others might choose more unique or specialty beverages. However, without specific information from the provided sources, it's not possible to definitively say what the drink of choice is for Haskell developers who want to use cool libraries.

> this is a joke for a project name smh, please make up something funny

For a funny project name that plays on the idea of Haskell developers wanting to use cool libraries, you could consider something like "Haskell Hipsters: Where Cool Libraries Meet Caffeine." This name combines the playful image of Haskell developers as hipsters with a nod to their love for using cool libraries, and humorously suggests that they might be fueled by caffeine, a common beverage among developers.

> yeah I kinda need a single word

For a single-word, funny project name related to Haskell and its libraries, you might consider "Haskelicious." This name plays on the word "delicious," suggesting that using Haskell and its libraries is as delightful and satisfying as enjoying a great meal. It's a light-hearted way to acknowledge the joy and efficiency that can come from working with Haskell and its extensive library ecosystem.

The computer says it's haskelicious, sorry, nothing I can do.
